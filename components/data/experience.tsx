        "As a System Development Intern (Mobile Flutter Developer) at AXA Mandiri, I contributed to the development and maintenance of cross-platform mobile applications for Android and iOS using Flutter. I was responsible for developing a major feature on the frontend, focusing on responsive UI and reliable performance. I implemented user interfaces by translating Figma designs into clean, reusable Flutter widgets through close collaboration with the UI/UX team, and integrated RESTful APIs by handling JSON data in coordination with backend developers to ensure smooth data flow. Throughout the development process, I followed clean coding practices, participated in code reviews, and was actively involved in the full development lifecycle, including daily stand-ups and regular progress checkpoints. I also used Git for version control to collaborate effectively with the team, manage code changes, and support an efficient development workflow.",
